       TLS authentication based on decentralized trust and straightforward
                  bindings of AAA information to application
                    layer using well-defined mechanism.


Abstract

   This document specifies proof of concept and prototype of TLS side channel 
   autentication based on standard and well defined mechanism. TLS hello 
   message extensions are used to determine which attributes, operations and 
   secure channel protocols are supported by both TLS endpoints.

1. Introduction

   Keying Material Exporter allow additional keying material to be derived from
   existing TLS channel and this exported keying material can then be used for 
   a variety of purposes. 

   This document specifies attributes, operations and authentication workflow 
   for the process of channel binding on top of secure channel protocols with 
   cryptographic integrity, confidentiality and straightforward bindings of
   AAA information to application layer using well-defined mechanism.


1.1. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [N1].

   The syntax for the supplemental_data and other attributes in handshake 
   message are defined in Terminology section 4.2. of this document.


2.  TLS side channel authentication

2.1.  The Initial SCA Handshake

   Alternately, it is also possible to do a double handshake where the server 
   sends the SupplementalData information during both the first and the second 
   handshake. Depending on the configuration, the server can decide if a 
   second handshake is required.

2.2.  The Initial SCA Double Handshake

   The double handshake technique can be used to provide protection for the 
   SupplementalData information and mechanism for synchronization channel 
   binding process.

   Figure 2.2.1. illustrates the message flow for the double handshake 
   technique.

4. Terminology

4.1.  Keywords

   AAA                     Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting:
                           functions that are generally required to control 
                           access to a service and support auditing.

   PRF                     Pseudorandom functions are deterministic functions 
                           which return pseudorandom output indistinguishable 
                           from random sequences. 

                           They are made based on pseudorandom generators but 
                           contrary to them, in addition to the internal state, 
                           they can accept any input data. The input may be 
                           arbitrary but the output must always look completely 
                           random.

                           A pseudorandom function, which output is 
                           indistinguishable from random sequences, is called 
                           a secure one.a

   Confidentiality         Ensuring the information exchanged between two 
                           parties is confidential between them and is not 
                           visible to anyone else.

   Integrity               Ensuring that message integrity is not changed while
                           in transit.

   Secure channel          A packet, datagram, octet stream connection, or
                           sequence of connections between two end-points that 
                           affords cryptographic integrity and confidentiality 
                           to data exchanged over it. 

   Channel binding         the process of establishing that no MITM exists 
                           between two end-points that have been authenticated
                           using secure channel.

4.2.  Attributes

   tls_channel             Abstract attribute asociation with TLS Channel

   tls_session_id          TLS Session identifier is a unique value generated 
                           by a server that identifies a particular session.

                           Interaction with TLS Session ID
                           https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5077#page-9

   tls_binding_id          Uniquely identifies Channel Binding process.

   tls_binding_key         Exported Keying Material [RFC-5705]

                           TLS Binding Key is derived keying material from 
                           existing TLS channel exactly after initial full 
                           handshake and before any application layer data are 
                           transmitted over TLS.

                           This keying material can then used for mutual side 
                           channel authentication using process of channel 
                           binding on top of secure channel with cryptographic
                           integrity and confidentiality.

                           If no context is provided, it then computes:
                           PRF(SecurityParameters.master_secret, label,
                               SecurityParameters.client_random +
                               SecurityParameters.server_random
                           )[length]

                           If context is provided, it computes:
                           PRF(SecurityParameters.master_secret, label,
                               SecurityParameters.client_random +
                               SecurityParameters.server_random +
                               context_value_length + context_value
                           )[length]

                           Note that exporter labels have the potential to 
                           collide with existing PRF labels. In order to 
                           prevent this, tls_binding_key labels MUST begin 
                           with "AAA_BINDING".

   aaa_binding_key         TLS side channel authentication requires one more 
                           key derivation because exported keying material and
                           master secret is not cryptographically bound to 
                           important session parameters such as server public.

                           In case of server public key it computes:
                           PRF(tls_binding_key,
                               tls_channel.server_public_key)

                           In case of certificate public key it computes:
                           computes:
                           PRF(tls_binding_key, 
                               tls_channel.server_cert_public_key)

   aaa_session_id          The AAA Session ID MUST be assigned by the server 
                           which is protected by double handshake technique for 
                           the succesfull authentication process.

                           https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5077#page-9

   aaa_protocol            Identifies secure channel protocol.

   aaa_authority           Uniquely identifies secure channel authority.

   aaa_message_type        Custom message types
   aaa_message_text        Custom message text related to aaa_message_type


5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Keying Material Exporters for TLS 

   Keying Material Exporter labels have the potential to collide with existing 
   PRF labels. In order to prevent this, tls_binding_key labels MUST begin with 
   "AAA_BINDING" and aaa_session_key MUST begin with "AAA_SESSION".


5.2.  Handshake Message for Supplemental Data

   This specification defines a new handshake message type that bundles 
   together all data objects that are to be delivered to the protected 
   application layer and sends them in a single handshake message. 

   This extension MUST be enabled on TLS channel.


5.3.  Renegotiation Indication Extension

   This specification defines a TLS extension to cryptographically tie 
   renegotiations to the TLS connections they are being performed over. 

   This extension MUST be must be enabled for the double handshake technique.


5.4.  Session Hash and Extended Master Secret Extension

   Exported keying material and master secret is not cryptographically bound 
   to important session parameters such as the server certificate and/or server
   public key and that is the reason why we introduce aaa_binding_key.

   Consequently, it is possible for an active attacker to set up two sessions,
   one with a client and another with a server, such that the master secrets on
   the two sessions are the same.  Thereafter, any mechanism that relies on the
   master secret for authentication, including session resumption, becomes 
   vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, where the attacker can simply 
   forward messages back and forth between the client and server.
